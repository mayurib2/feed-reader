# Feed Reader

This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The goal of this project is to write Jasmine test suites to check proper functionality of the application.

## Getting Started

Clone/Download the project and launch the .html file to load the application.

## Jasmine Outcomes

Test suites are written in the feedreader.js file. Any future tests must be added here. Jasmine outcomes are as follows:

* Green indicates tests that have passed
* Red indicates failed tests

Failed tests also indicate the line number at which the test failed making debugging easier. For more info on Jasmine check out the documentation [here](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/docs_home.html)
